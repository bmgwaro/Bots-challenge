   - To permanently remove a bot from your army and the backend, click on the red "x" button below the the bot's picture.
   - This action will delete the bot from both your army and the backend database, making it unavailable for future enlistment.

   - You can continue adding, releasing, and discharging bots as needed to manage your army effectively.
   - Your bot army will always display the current bots in your army, allowing you to keep track of your enlisted forces.
